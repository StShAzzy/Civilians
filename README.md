adds commands that allows players to turn into a civilian

### Commands
# sm_civ // Turns the player who typed the command on a civilian
# sm_tpose // same as above
# sm_civilian // same as above
# sm_apose // same as above
# sm_aciv // Makes so the player who typed the command always respawns as a civilian, can only be toggled
# sm_atpose // same as above

there's some more polishing to be done, like the text telling you that you'll become a civilian being shown when using alwayscivilian
